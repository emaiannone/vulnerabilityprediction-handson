# Fundamentals of Mining Software Repositories for Vulnerability Prediction - The Practical Perspective

This repository contains a simple implementation of a pipeline for building a vulnerability prediction model, with particular focus on the data mining side. The notebook is implemented in Jupyter Lab.

First, make sure to install Jupyter Lap on your machine: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html

Then, clone this repository, move into its root directory and run the Jupyter Lab server: `jupyter lab`.

Afterwards, the default browser's window automatically pops up, from which you can open the notebook `notebook.ipynb`. From this moment on, you can follow the steps described in the notebook.

The repository already contains all the results of a full execution of the notebook. If you want to re-run it from scratch, just delete every file in `data/` with the exceptions of `dump/partial_dump.json`.
